Feature: Manage Clients
  In order to efficiently access and store client data in our intranet
  As a staff member
  I want to create and manage clients
  
  # TODO: test this again maybe without javascript
  # Scenario: Search Clients by client code
  #   Given I have client codes AA, AAA, AAI
  #   When I search for "AA"
  #   Then I should see "AA"
  #   And I should see "AAA"
  #   And I should see "AAI"
